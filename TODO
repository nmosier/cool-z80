0. handle page-swapping: use bcall() for now -- maybe reimplement later.
   * how to implemement page swapping for dynamic dispatch?
     (a) copy instruction sequence to RAM and change address (but what about nested bcalls?)
     (b) create PLT -- safer, but slower (requires 2 bcalls, as opposed to 1)
         (i) entries of form:
             
             _dispent_dynamic.<METHOD>:
             call 50h
             #define _dispent_static.<METHOD> $-4000h ;; entry point for StaticDispatch
             .dw <METHOD>
             .db <METHOD's PAGE>
             (6 bytes total)
         (ii)
             
1. implement garbage collection
   (a) propogate GC tag in Object.copy()
2. implement big arithmetic
3. modify library code to only use stack as scratch
4. start simple optimizer
5. functionality to wrap ASM in functions?
