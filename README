NAME
   cool-z80 - a compiler from COOL to Z80 assembly and TI 83+/84+ programs

DESCRIPTION

cool-z80 is a compiler for MiddCool that produces Z80 assembly code and
TI 83+/84+ graphing calculator flash applications. (MiddCool is a
modification of the COOL Programming Language.) The compiler currently
supports all core MiddCool language features and features a custom
implementation of the COOL runtime system for TI-OS (the operating
system of TI 83+/84+ calculators).

The compiler consists of four modules - the lexer, parser, semantic
analyzer, and code generator. The code generator outputs Z80 assembly,
which is then assembled into a TI-OS flash application using the
assembler spasm-ng.


HISTORY

The code for cool-z80 is based on a fully-functional MiddCool-to-MIPS
compiler I wrote for Compiler Design over the course of a semester
(Sep - Dec 2017). cool-z80's lexer (using flex), parser (using bison),
and semantic analyzer remain unchanged from this earlier project, but
cool-z80's entire code generator has been rewritten.

FUTURE WORK

Bug fixes
Support for multipage applications (currently only supports single-page applications, up to 16 KB in size)
Garbage collection
Big arithmetic
Code optimization module
Language extensions (arrays, etc.)
