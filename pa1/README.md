# CS433 Programming Assignment 1: Introduction to Cool

## Files

Your assignment directory should contain the following files:

1. `atoi.cl`: An implementation in Cool of the string-integer conversion functions.
2. `stack.cl`: The skeleton file for your program.
3. `stack.test`: A short test input to the stack machine.
4. `README.md`: This file. You will need to edit the README file with your write-up.

## Instructions

To compile your Cool program:

```
../bin/coolc -o stack.s stack.cl atoi.cl
```

And to run the corresponding assembly file with SPIM:

```
../bin/spim -- -file stacks.s < stack.test
```

*Note* the double dashes, these are required and separate the arguments to the script that
runs `cool-spim` and the arguments to `cool-spim` itself. 

Instructions for turning in the assignment will be posted on the course site. Make sure to complete the writeup below.

## Write-up

1. Describe your implementation of the stack machine in a single short paragraph.


2. List 3 things that you like about the Cool programming language.


3. List 3 things you *don't* like about Cool.
